 **Feedback Analysis**

The previous feedback highlighted several areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of clarity in the problem statement:** The problem statement was not clear and did not provide sufficient details about the expected outcome.

2. **Insufficient design details:** The design section lacked specific details about the HTML files and routes required for the Flask application.

3. **Absence of user interface (UI) considerations:** The feedback mentioned that the design did not address the UI aspects of the application, such as layout, styling, and user interactions.

**Improvements for This Run**

Based on the feedback received, I plan to make the following improvements in this run:

1. **Clearer problem statement:** I will refine the problem statement to provide a more precise description of the expected movie feed application. This will include specifying the purpose, target audience, and key features of the application.

2. **Detailed design:** I will provide a more comprehensive design for the Flask application, including the structure of the HTML files and the routes that will be used to handle user requests. This will include information about the data sources, data processing, and presentation logic.

3. **UI considerations:** I will incorporate UI considerations into the design, such as the layout, styling, and user interactions. This will involve creating mockups or prototypes to demonstrate the visual appearance and functionality of the application.
